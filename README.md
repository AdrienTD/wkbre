# wkbre
Warrior Kings (Battles) engine recreation

wkbre is an engine that uses exactly the same files as both games.
This means you need a copy of the game if you want to execute wkbre.
(However it is possible to run wkbre without owning the game, but then
you will need to write all the game data files yourself.)

This program is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL 3.
Use this software at your own risk!

To run wkbre, you must first open settings.txt and change the GAME_DIR
value to the path of WK's game data (with data.bcp and saved directory).
