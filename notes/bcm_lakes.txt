Size of structure
	beginning 0xC000 bytes after the sky box directory string
	ending at the beginning of the table of textures (containing for example GRASS, ...)

4 peaks		0xD  = 13
chokepoint	0xD  = 13
bad place	0xA0 = 160

160 / 13 = 12, ... (?) lakes in Bad Place

BUT in reality there seem to be 11 lakes!


What can be stored in 13 bytes?

Num bytes	Usage
4		X (float)
4		Y (float)
4		Z (float)
1		Height

Eureka!
