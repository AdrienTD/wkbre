WKO Script oddities

 - CHANGE_REACTION_PROFILE ADD/REMOVE instead of ADD_REACTION/REMOVE_REACTION

 - TERMINATE_THIS_ORDER without ACTION

 - INDIVIDUAL_ITEM for declaring items

 - NUM_REFERENCERS which doesn't exist in WKB
   (use FINDER_RESULTS_COUNT instead)

 - ENODE BUILDING_TYPE_OPERAND instead of ENODE BUILDING_TYPE

 - NUM_ASSOCIATES/NUM_ASSOCIATORS don't exist in WKB
   (use NUM_OBJECTS FINDER_ASSOCIATES/FINDER_ASSOCIATORS instead)

 - PLAY_SOUND_AT_POSITION "snd" <FINDER> instead of
   PLAY_SOUND_AT_POSITION "snd" <POSITION>
   (maybe someone forgot LOCATION_OF)

 - The meaning of OBJECT_ID is different in both versions.
   WKO: OBJECT_ID <FINDER:A> <FINDER:B>
        Returns 1 if A == B, otherwise 0.
   WKB: OBJECT_ID <FINDER:A>
        Returns the object id of A.
   When porting from WKO to WKB, OBJECT_ID should be replaced with
   IS_SUBSET_OF.
