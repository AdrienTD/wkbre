Things not related to "game emulation" but will be eventually done in the future:
- Remove dependency on D3DX9.
  --> Own texture loading.
  --> Own font drawing.
  --> Own vector structure and functions.
- OpenGL (use a setting to switch from Direct3D to OpenGL and vice versa)
- SDL (for compatibility with other OSes than Windows, like Linux, Mac OS X, ...)
  --> Put dialog boxes inside the game window?

--- 0.0.4 ---

OPEN SOURCE RELEASE!

To add:

  and put a pointer to this structure in GameObject.
