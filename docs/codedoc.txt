//*** How to compile ***//

Using the Microsoft (Visual) C/C++ compiler:
	- Open a Windows SDK or Visual C++ command prompt (32 bits). You can
	  find it in the Start menu/screen.
	- cd to the directory of the source code.
	- Type: vc_compall
	- The new executable will be named "wkbre_vc.exe"

Using MinGW-32:
	- Open a command prompt. Be sure that the bin directory of the MinGW
	  installation is in the environment path.
	- cd to the directory of the source code.
	- Type: mg_compall
	- The new executable will be named "wkbre_mg.exe"

vc_release.bat and mg_release.bat are similar to vc_compall.bat and
mg_compall.bat, but they remove certain features of the program which aren't
user-friendly, for example debugging features and incomplete features.
