<h1>wkbre Help file</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>wkbre is a program in which you can load, edit and save saved games of Warrior Kings (Battles). Additionally, it loads the game set, including the .cpp files, meshes, textures, …, so you can get a 3D view looking exactly as in the game.</p>
<p>But wkbre is currently incomplete. There may be some bugs in it. It may not load and save games properly, it cannot edit everything and the landscape has only a green texture.</p>
<h2>Start</h2>
<p>If wkbre doesn’t start, be sure that the Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86) and the latest DirectX runtime are installed. If not, you can download them from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download">http://www.microsoft.com/download</a> .</p>
<p>First you need to configure the "settings.txt" file. Ensure that the GAME_DIR value is the directory of the game (with "data.bcp" and the "saved" folder). The other settings are not important.</p>
<p>After setting the GAME_DIR value you can start the executable (wkbre.exe). You will be asked which saved game you want to load. Select a file in the list then click OK or double-click on the file to open it.</p>
<p>The landscape may look incorrect. If it does, press the '0' key repeatedly until the landscape is correct.</p>
<p>Use the arrow, ‘E’ and ‘D’ keys to move the camera.</p>
<p>Click an object to select it. Press the Control key and the arrow keys at the same time to move the selected object. You can also press the Insert key to duplicate the selected object, the Delete key to delete it, and the * or / key to change the size. Look at the menu bar in the program or the Keys section of this document for a list of available commands.</p>
<p>Once you have finished doing some modifications in the level, press F3 and type the name of the new savegame. The name should end with “.sav”, otherwise the game won’t display it in its list.</p>
<h2>Keys</h2>
<p>The number (0-9) keys in the numeric keypad (NumPad) cannot be used.</p>

<h2>Known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>The landscape looks incorrect when using WKBattles files.</b>
<br>Press the '0' key repeatedly until the landscape is correct.</li>
<s>
<li><b>Some parts of the manor and the village are black.</b>
<br>To correct this issue, go to the settings.txt file and change the value of TEXTURE_COMPRESSION to 0.</li>
</s>
<li><b>Texture compression is disabled even with TEXTURE_COMPRESSION 0 in settings.txt</b>
<br>The texture loading in version 0.0.3 has been rewritten, and the new code doesn’t support texture compression for various reasons.</li>
<li><b>I don't see the landscape!</b>
<br>The landscape mesh has too many primitives and your video card doesn’t support that. In “settings.txt” look for MAP_MAX_PART_SIZE and set lower values.</li>
<li><b>wkbre is frozen / stops drawing.</b>
<br>Minimize and restore the window.</li>
<li><b>When I load a savegame made with wkbre in the original engine, there are some issues. The AI doesn’t work well, the formations move poorly, …</b>
<br>This is going to be fixed in a next release.</li>
<li><b>I don’t find my savegame in WKB.</b>
<br>Look at every tab (skirmish, campaign, multiplayer).</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy! :) </p>
