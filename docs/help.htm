<h1>wkbre v0.0.8.0 Help file</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><b><i>wkbre</i></b> is a engine reimplementation of the game <b>Warrior Kings (Battles)</b> (developed by Black Cactus) in which you can load, edit, play and save saved games of the game. It loads the game set, including the .cpp files, meshes, textures, …, so you can get a 3D view looking exactly as in the game.</p>
<p>The program is open source and is licensed under the GNU GPL 3. The source code and the latest build are available here: <a href="https://github.com/AdrienTD/wkbre">https://github.com/AdrienTD/wkbre</a></p>

<h2>Start</h2>
<p>First you need to configure the "settings.txt" file. Ensure that the <b>GAME_DIR</b> value is the directory of the game (with "data.bcp" and the "saved" folder). The other settings are not important.</p>
<p>Now you can start the executable (wkbre.exe). If it doesn’t start, be sure that the Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86) and the latest DirectX runtime are installed. If not, you can download them from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download">http://www.microsoft.com/download</a> .</p>
<p>You will be asked which saved game you want to load. Select a file in the list then click OK or double-click on the file to open it.</p>
<p>Use the <b>arrow</b>, <b>‘E’</b> and <b>‘D’</b> keys to move the camera. Hold the <b>NumPad 0</b> key and move the mouse to rotate the camera.</p>
<p><b>Click</b> an object to select it. Press the <b>Control</b> key and the <b>arrow</b> keys at the same time to move the selected object. You can also press the <b>Insert</b> or <b>N</b> key to duplicate the selected object, the <b>Delete</b> key to delete it, and the <b>*</b> or <b>/</b> key to change the size. Look at the menu bar in the program or the Keys section of this document for a list of available commands.</p>
<p>Click <b>Window > Selected object information</b> to open a window where you can view and edit properties of the selected object.</p>
<p>To create a new object, click <b>Window > Object creation</b> and a window will open. First click the white box next to <b>"Give to:"</b> to select the player you want to give the new object, then click in the big list <b>the type of the new object</b>. You can shorten the list by typing a part of the type name in the <b>"Filter"</b> text box. Once you have chosen a type in the list box, do a <b>right-click on the game view</b> to create the object.</p>
<p>Once you have finished doing some modifications in the level, press <b>F3</b> and type the name of the new savegame. The name should end with <b>“.sav”</b> (for a savegame) or <b>“.lvl”</b> (for a new skirmish level), otherwise the game won’t display it in its list.</p>

<h2>Creating new custom maps</h2>
<p>wkbre v0.0.8 has new features and improvements with which it is easier to make new custom maps that you can play against AIs and real human players.</p>
<p>When you first start wkbre, you can see the option <b>&lt;New empty level></b>. If you choose it, you will get an empty level with a flat terrain, 8 players and no more objects, so that you can create a new map from scratch.</p>
<p>Click <b>Window > Map editor</b> to open the map editor window, which provides you functions to modify the terrain. In the Tools section you can find tools like terrain height (vertex) elevation, texture changing, lake insertion, etc.</p>
<p>If you want to save the terrain, type a name in the <b>Name</b> textbox, then click the either "Save SNR" or "Save BCM". The difference between the SNR and BCM formats are:</p>
<ul>
<li>SNR is compatible with both WK and WKB, and uses a set of text and bitmap (PCX) files, so that you can edit the map without the editor. The downside is that it can become really big if the map is large. For example for a 1024x1024 sized map, it might take ~62 MB (whereas as BCM it is ~2MB).</li>
<li>BCM is a binary file format that can have smaller sizes, but the disadvantage is that it is only supported in WKBattles and not the first WK.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find your saved terrain files in <b>&lt;GAME_DIR>\saved\Maps\&lt;name>\&lt;name>.snr/.bcm</b>.</p>
<p>Please note that SNR and BCM "map files" only contain the terrain and eventually lakes. They don't contain any objects like units and buildings. The objects are saved in the "savegame" (SAV) or "level" (LVL).</p>
<p>When you save your terrain, the current savegame/level will be automatically bound to the saved terrain. To check to which map file the current savegame is bound, go to <b>Window > Level information > Properties > Map:</b>.</p>
<p>Click <b>Window > City creator</b> to open a window where you create cities with automatically a manor inside and peasants in front of it. First click the <b>Add/remove city</b> radio button, then <b>choose a player</b>, and <b>right-click</b> on the area where you want to put the city. You can press R before right-clicking to rotate the manor.</p>
<p>You can now put objects like trees and props with <b>Window > Object creation</b>. Be sure that the <b>Send "On Stampdown" event</b> checkbox is disabled for most cases. For objects like trees that are not owned by human players, give them to the <b>Neutral Player</b>.</p>
<p>The developers of the game have left in WKBattles' game set scripts certain special objects that, by stamping them down, will generate lots of trees around, so that you don't have to create every single tree. To do this, check the <b>Send "On Stampdown" event</b> then in the <b>Filter</b> box, type <b>auto</b>. In the listbox, click for example <b>MARKER "AutoTrees Coniferous-10"</b>. By creating it, you will get 10 trees as well as some bushes and birds! Try other auto markers as well. If you don't need auto objects anymore, be sure to disable the On Stampdown checkbox back.</p>
<p>You also need to set the starting camera position of every player. To do this, open <b>Window > Selected object information</b>, then go to <b>Window > Level information > Human players list</b>, click a player, and in the Selected object window, click <b>Start camera</b>. You should see the button <b>Set</b>. Move your camera and click this button to set the starting camera position of the selected player object to the current position of the camera.</p>
<p>To save the level, press <b>F3</b> and type a name with an ending of <b>.lvl</b> . Note that if you have modified the terrain/map, be sure to save the terrain/map before saving the level/savegame, so that the level is already bound to the modified terrain.</p>
<p>To play your custom level in the game, be sure that you have installed <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WARKC/discussions/0/1319961618834033179/">my unofficial patch</a>. This patch will make custom levels appear in the skirmish and multiplayer menus.</p>
<p>If you want to play your custom level in multiplayer, be sure that you give to all players the terrain file (SNR/BCM) and the level file (LVL/SAV) which must be installed in the same directories as they were found on your computer ("saved" directory).</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>
<p>wkbre v0.0.7 now adds a few floating windows which allows you to view/edit a lot of properties the savegame and its objects. You can open them via the <b>Window</b> submenu.</p>
<p>The windows are:</p>

<h3>Selected object information</h3>
<p>This shows information/properties of the first selected object. If no object is selected, it shows nothing.</p>
<p>The window is divided in groups that are all closed by default. To open one, click it.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <b>Transform</b> group, you can edit the position, orientation and the scale of the object that you can modify by dragging a number with the mouse. If you want to modify the scale and orientation of multiple objects at the same time, click the buttons below "Copy to all sel. objects.".</li>
<li>In <b>Appearance</b> you can change the subtype and the appearance.</li>
<li>In <b>Items</b> you can change the values of the items (for example: Food, Gold, Hit Points, ...). The 3 radio buttons as well as the <b>Filter</b> text box allows you to search for items easily.</li>
<li>In <b>Flags</b> you can set/unset certain flags, or even disable/enable the object. Note that unrenderable and disabled objects will still be shown in the editor, but not in the original game engine.</li>
<li>In <b>Order configuration</b> you can see the orders and tasks the object is currently doing.</li>
<li>In <b>Individual reactions</b> you can add and remove reactions.</li>
<li>In <b>Association</b> you can see the associates and associators in an association category.</li>
<li>If a PLAYER object is selected, you will also see the <b>Start camera</b> group, where you see and change the starting position of the player's camera.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Level tree</h3>
<p>Here you can view the whole tree of the objects in the level. Click a node to show its subordinates. Right-click a node to select the object (SHIFT+right-click to add to selection).</p>

<h3>Level information</h3>
<p>Like the Selected object information window, the window is divised in groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>In <b>Properites</b>, you can change the gameset, map and game type. Changes on these values will only take effect after the savegame is saved and reopened, and might make the savegame unopenable if they are incorrect. In this case you can always change them with a text editor and searching for GAME_SET, GAME_TYPE and MAP.</li>
<li>In <b>Time</b>, you can see the current time and modify the lock count. For example if you lose a campaign in the first WK, the level will be locked. You can then unlock the game by setting the lock count back to 0.</li>
<li>In <b>Alias</b>, you can see and modify the alias groups.</li>
<li>In <b>Diplomatic relationships</b> you can see and modify the relationships between two players.</li>
<li><b><u>NEW</u></b> In <b>Human players list</b> you can see the list of human players (for skirmish and multiplayer). You can add and remove human players, which changes the number of players required for the level. It is also possible to move the players in the list, so you can swap the positions of the players with few clicks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Object creation</h3>
<p>Here you can easily create new objects. See the Start section of this document for a guide on how to use it.</p>
<p>The <b>Send "On Stampdown" event</b> checkbox will execute some game script after the object is created. This is especially needed for some MARKER objects. For example for a MARKER "AutoTrees ..." object this will automatically generate trees around the position of the new marker. For a village building, this will also automatically generate a cart. Sometimes this feature is important as the script that will be executed will initialise the new object properly. It is recommended to enable this feature with SAV files and to disable it with non-started LVL files.</p>

<h3>Map editor</h3>
<p>The map editor allows you create, open and edit map files (terrains).</p>
<p>At the beginning you see a textbox for the name of the terrain you want to open or the name you want to save your terrain as.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Save SNR</b> and <b>Save BCM</b> buttons save the terrain in either the SNR or BCM format respectively with the name above.</li>
<li>The <b>New</b> allows you to create an empty terrain. It will ask you the size of your new map, then you click OK.</li>
<li>The <b>Open</b> allows you to open an existing terrain. It will ask you the file path, then click OK to open it. Type the name in Name textbox before clicking Open to automatically obtain the path.</li>
<li>In <b>Heightmap</b>:
<ul>
<li>Click <b>Copy</b> to copy the heightmap in the system clipboard, so that you can paste it in painting programs like Paint, GIMP, or Photoshop.</li>
<li>Click <b>Paste</b> to paste the heightmap copied from another program. Be sure that the size of the bitmap is (mapwidth+1)x(mapheight+1). If you want to change the size of the terrain, then create a new one with the size that matches with the heightmap you want to paste.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>In the <b>Tools</b> section, you can find these tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Default</b> is the standard tool (select game objects).</li>
<li>The <b>Texture</b> allows you to change the textures of the tiles of the terrain. You first need to select a texture in the <b>Texture</b> section. Then click on the terrain to apply the new texture. Do a right-click if you want to select the texture that is on the tile you are pointing to on the terrain.</li>
<li>The <b>Autotiles</b> is similar to <b>Texture</b> but will also automatically determine the textures for the tiles around the tile you clicked so that they match with the rest of the terrain.</li>
<li>The <b>Elevate</b> tool allows you to change the height of the terrain. Do a click to make the area higher, or a right-click to make it lower.</li>
<li>The <b>Flatten</b> tool will copy the height of the tile you clicked and apply to every vertex you point at while keeping the left mouse button pressed.</li>
<li>With the <b>Add lake</b> you can add new lakes.</li>
<li>With the <b>Move lake</b> you can move lakes by pressing the left mouse button on a lake.</li>
<li>With the <b>Remove lake</b> you can remove a lake by clicking it.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also change the size and the shape (square, circle) of the brush or area you want to modify. This only concerns the tools Texture, Elevate and Flatten.</p>
<p>In the <b>Properties</b> section:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Map size</b> is the size of the whole terrain. You cannot modify it, unless you create a new terrain.</li>
<li><b>Level size</b> is the size of the area where the objects can be placed, it is the map size without the edge.</li>
<li><b>Edge</b> is the number of tiles at every edge of the terrain that are not part of the level and are out of bounds. Changing it changes the level size.</li>
<li><b>Sun color</b> is the color of the sun. I don't know if that's even used.</li>
<li><b>Sun vector</b> is the vector of the direction of a sun lightray. Note that it is opposite to the direction of the movement of the lightray. Or in other words, the vector goes towards the sun. This is because the sun vector is used to calculate its dot product with the normal of a surface to get its lightning.</li>
<li><b>Fog color</b> is the color of the fog.</li>
<li><b>Skybox</b> is the path to the folder of the skybox you want to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <b>Texture</b> section:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <b>Group</b> listbox, you select the group of textures (or type of texture).</li>
<li>In the box below, you select the texture you want to use. When hovering a texture, a tooltip will display the ID of the texture.</li>
<li>In <b>Rotation</b> you can rotate the texture by 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees.</li>
<li>In <b>Flip</b> you can flip the texture in the X and/or Z direction.</li>
<li>If the <b>Randomize textures</b> checkbox is checked, and you use the Texture tool, then the program will choose another texture from the same group for the next draw.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <b>Lakes</b> section:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Clear</b> button will remove all lakes.</li>
<li>The <b>Floodfill</b> button will reinitialize the lake tiles and refill the terrain with water.</li>
<li>If <b>Floodfill when heightmap changes</b> is checked, then a floodfill is automatically done if the terrain height is changed.</li>
<li>At the end you can see a <b>list of all lakes with their starting position and height</b>. You can remove a lake individually by clicking the <b>X</b> button.</li>
</ul>

<h3>City creator</h3>
<p>To create a new city with a manor inside, click the <b>Add/remove city</b>, choose a player, then click on the terrain where you want to create the city. You can also right-click an existing manor city to remove it. In the window you can also change the size, the number of peasants as well as if you want flags in front of the city or not.</p>

<h2>Playing games in wkbre</h2>
<p>wkbre is also able to let you play the game. This is done by interpreting the game set script which can be found in the game data (data.bcp).</p>
<p>When you press <b>'P'</b>, the game will be unpaused. You can see your units moving, peasants doing their work, units attacking, etc...</p>
<p>When you have selected an unit you can also give it an order by <b>right-clicking</b> a target, or press <b>'A'</b> to execute button commands.</p>
<p>Please note that savegames with AI players might not work because some game set script features related to AI are not supported yet.</p>
<p>If you have opened a lvl file, you can press <b>'S'</b> to start the level (for example in a tutorial this will show the first message).</p>
<p>You can also take control of the camera of a player/client with <b>'F'</b>.</p>
<p>Finally, press <b>'Enter'</b> to switch into a "Game" interface.</p>
<p>See the Keys section and the "Game" submenu in the menu bar for a list of available commands.</p>
<p>Also please keep in mind that the ability to play games in wkbre is "experimental", this means some features are missing and bugs can be encountered.</p>

<h2>Known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>The Autotiles doesn't work correctly</b>
<br>I've spent a lot of time implementing and I don't know how the autotiling feature really works (the information is present in data.bcp\Maps\Map_Textures\All_Textures.dat).</li>
<li><b>When using WK data, some map textures are totally red (not found).</b>
<br>This is because of how textures are stored in game data. When you take a look at the All_Textures.dat file, you can see that it references files like grass1.pcx which can be found at Maps\Map_Textures. This file exists in WKB, but not the first WK. Instead, you see in Maps\Map_Textures LTTT files as well as the "Packed" folder. The LTTT contains a table that translates a file name like grass1.pcx into a file name in the Packed folder. It also translates the position of the textures in the bitmap. There is a LTTT for every existing map. And the problem is that the LTTT only contains translations for textures that are used in the terrain, meaning that if for example the snow texture is not used in the map, then there is no information which allows us to know in which file in the "Packed" folder it is present. So wkbre doesn't find it and uses the sad red smiley texture instead.
<br>Also, if you create a new map, no LTTT is loaded, meaning that wkbre expects for example the file grass1.pcx to really exist.
<br>A possible solution is to copy the textures from WKB to WK.</li>
<li><b>The minimap is only green and blue!</b>
<br>At the moment, wkbre will make a green minimap based on the heightmap and the lakes. This might be improved in the future.</li>
<li><b>Texture compression is disabled even with TEXTURE_COMPRESSION 1 in settings.txt</b>
<br>The texture loading in version 0.0.3 has been rewritten, and the new code doesn’t support texture compression for various reasons.</li>
<li><b>wkbre is frozen / stops drawing.</b>
<br>Minimize and restore the window. If it still does not draw, close it. Don't forget the task manager!</li>
<li><b>When I load a savegame made with wkbre in the original engine, there are some issues. The AI doesn’t work well, the formations move poorly, …</b>
<br>This is going to be fixed in a next release.</li>
<li><b>I don’t find my savegame in WKB.</b>
<br>Look at every tab (skirmish, campaign, multiplayer).</li>
<li><b>Firing units like light infantry and light cavalry spawn missiles that don't hurt the enemies!</b>
<br>wkbre's support for missiles is poor at the moment.</li>
<!--<li><b>With WKBattles or WK 1.4 data, starting the level when the level has already been started will cause an infinite loop.</b>
<br>This bug seems to occur in the original engine too.</li>-->
<li><b>There are bugs!</b>
<br>Leave these poor living spirits alone! Anyway they will be squashed in the near or distant future.</li>
</ul>

<!--
<h2>Bro tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>After loading a lvl file, press <b>'S'</b>, <b>'F'</b>, <b>'Enter'</b>, then <b>'P'</b> to directly play it.</li>
<li>In WKB, if you want to quickly create trees, select an object, press <b>'V'</b>, and choose <b>MARKER AutoTree...</b>.</li>
<li>In WKB, if you want an AI-controlled sapper, scout, succubus or arch druid, use the <b>'V'</b> command.
</ul>
<p>The last two tips can also be done with the new <b>Objects creation</b> window with the <b>Send "On Stampdown" event</b> checkbox enabled.</p>
